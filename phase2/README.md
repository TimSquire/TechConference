# Conference App
## Phase 1

#### Running the program
Run the main method in the *Routes* class.  
Then, go to a browser and in the url bar enter: localhost:8000/home
Login with one of the sample accounts found in the *PopulateData* class.

#### Initializing Sample Data
The outline of our sample data is specified in the following google sheets document:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEoy0KsoStEYwMr6JGJyPQXe6ZQaX8DPHDFgEOVMGQA/edit?usp=sharing

If you wish to reset the data back to the sample data, run the class PopulateData in the Main package
If you wish to test an empty conference with no data, uncomment the specified block in PopulateData to write empty ArrayLists to the .ser files


Please use the web branch instead of the master branch. We had some issues merging it with master but the final code is all in the web branch
